ChatOps Deployment Bot – Project Overview

Slack-Integrated Deployments:
Trigger, monitor, approve, and rollback services directly from Slack using slash commands, interactive buttons, and modals.

GitHub Actions Automation:
Run workflows with parameters like service, version, and environment; view live updates and logs in Slack.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Map Slack users/roles to allowed actions and environments; require approvals for production deployments.

Real-Time Status Streaming:
Post live workflow progress, threaded logs, and final summaries to Slack channels for team visibility.

Audit & Observability:
Track every command and deployment outcome with immutable audit logs and correlation IDs; monitor lead time, success rate, and MTTR.

Safe & Resilient Deployments:
Concurrency controls, cooldown windows, idempotent commands, and recovery for in-flight runs ensure reliability.

Configurable & Extensible:
Store services, environments, workflow IDs, and Slack channel mappings in MongoDB; versioned configurations allow safe updates.

Developer-Friendly Local Setup:
Scripts to seed MongoDB, simulate GitHub webhooks, and run the bot locally; Docker support for consistent environments.

Benefits for Teams:
Reduces context switching, increases deployment safety, boosts transparency, and speeds up delivery with quick rollback/retry.

Tech Stack:
Node.js + Express, MongoDB, Slack Web & Events API, GitHub Actions API, Docker, and automated scripts.
